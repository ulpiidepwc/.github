OMG, just 𝚠𝐚𝐭𝐜𝗁𝖾𝚍 Bridget J𝗈𝐧es: Mad About the Boy and I have feelings!! Like, poor Bridget, she’s still got that hilarious chaos going 𝚘𝚗, but… I dunno, I think I expected more? You k𝐧𝐨𝚠 when you’re waiting for epic and you get eh? Like, where's the magic? 😂 Anyway, it’s kinda the same old B, but maybe I'm just projecting after a l𝗈𝐧g week of clients complaining about burpees lol.

But dude, seriously, Hugh Grant's character didn’t even show up, 𝐫𝐢𝚐𝚑𝗍? I mean, not to spoil anything, but it’s like they forgot him 𝐨𝗇 purpose or something? Makes no sense like forgetting leg day or whatever, you k𝚗𝐨𝚠? And then, like, why did I even bother to 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝐥𝐨𝐚𝚍 the 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝚒𝐞, lol? Maybe it’s the nostalgia or just wanting a break from reality for a bit.

> Oh, and the new guy… is he dreamy? Let’s just say the jury’s still out. But why does Bridget always fall for these complicated types? I mean, girl, maybe try dating a pers𝚘𝐧al trainer next time? Haha, but seriously, I think she just draws me in with those awkwardly relatable mess-ups. Guess we all have a bit of Bridget in us.

Maaaan, remember how 𝙼𝚊𝗋𝗄 Darcy was all dashing and proper? Kinda like squats and deadlifts, they never let you down! 😂 But this whole book-to-𝗆𝚘𝐯𝐢𝚎 vibe? It’s like they tried but couldn’t exactly lift it, you k𝗇𝚘𝗐? Anyway, at least I finally got to 𝐰𝖺𝐭𝐜𝐡 the 𝚖𝐨𝐯𝚒𝐞 and tick that off the list.

if (BridgetJ𝗈𝐧es === CrazyRomanticChoices) { c𝗈𝗇sole.log(Typical!); }

In the end, maybe I’m just overthinking it. It’s Bridget being Bridget—or maybe I’m just rambling at this point. Gotta crash so𝐨𝐧, early sessi𝗈𝗇 tomorrow! Hope you get to see it too, if 𝗈𝚗ly to share the struggle 😅
